#### Notes: 

##### Security related
As of October 23rd 2017 anti-piracy security updates, jscrambler obfuscation is now part of the game compilation process ( '-b' task from push.sh). 

In push.sh, added secure_strong and secure_regular: 
- secure_regular excludes framebreaker and copyright message (for clients typically -> easier for integration)  
- secure_strong has all the goods
